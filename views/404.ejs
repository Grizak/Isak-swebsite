        // History and Origin
        "404 was one of the standard HTTP status codes defined in 1992 as part of the Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP).",
        "It's rumored that 404 might be named after Room 404 at CERN, where the first web servers were hosted, but this is a myth.",
        "The default 404 error message was initially bland, stating something like: '404 Not Found: The requested URL was not found on this server.'",

        // Design and Creativity
        "Many websites have turned their 404 pages into works of art, like GitHub's Octocat in space or Netflix's static glitch effect.",
        "Some websites include games or fun experiences on their 404 pages, such as Google Chrome's Dinosaur Game or Pixar's references to lost characters.",
        "Some websites hide Easter eggs on their 404 pages, like Marvel's comic-style graphics referencing their vast universe.",

        // Technical and Interesting Uses
        "Custom 404 pages help reduce bounce rates and improve the user experience by guiding visitors back to the main site.",
        "A 404 page can occur due to a typo in the URL or misconfigured server, not just because a page is missing.",
        "A 'soft 404' occurs when a server returns a success status code (200) for a non-existent page, confusing search engines.",

        // Cultural Impact
        "Many people mistakenly believe '404' refers to a server problem, but it means the requested page doesn’t exist or has been moved.",
        "In slang, '404' means clueless or lost, as in: 'His brain is 404.'",
        "The term '404' occasionally appears in pop culture as a clever nod to tech-savvy audiences.",

        // Pop Culture
        "Artists have created songs and artworks inspired by the 404 error, symbolizing 'loss' or 'being lost.'",
        "The term '404' appears in movies and shows, often as an inside joke for tech enthusiasts.",

        // Educational Uses
        "Web developers use 404 pages to teach new coders how HTTP requests and status codes work.",
        "Coding tutorials often start by showing how to create a custom 404 page as a first project.",

        // Unique 404 Pages
        "Wikipedia's 404 page features a search box and says: 'The page does not exist. You can create it!'",
        "Lego's 404 page shows a broken Lego figure with the message: 'Uh oh, the page you’re looking for has fallen apart.'",
        "IMDB's 404 page displays famous movie quotes related to getting lost or finding things.",

        // Humorous Messages
        "Some 404 pages use puns, like: 'This page is taking a long vacation,' or, 'You’ve discovered a void where this page should be.'",
        "Developers sometimes embed jokes about being overworked or disappearing content on their 404 pages.",

        // Fun and Educational
        "NASA and space-themed sites often play with the idea of being 'lost in space' on their 404 pages.",
        "Some companies create elaborate fake 404 errors as pranks for April Fool's Day.",

        // Did You Know?
        "Among all HTTP status codes, 404 is the most recognized by the general public.",
        "If you've saved a webpage offline and try to access a non-existent page, you still see a 404 message!",
        "Good 404 pages can improve website rankings by reducing frustration and guiding users effectively.",
